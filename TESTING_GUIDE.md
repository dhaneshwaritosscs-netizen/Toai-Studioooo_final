# Testing Guide: Role-Based UI Changes

## ✅ Setup Complete
The admin role has been successfully assigned to `dhaneshwari.tosscss@gmail.com`.

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Admin Login (Original Features)
**Email:** `dhaneshwari.tosscss@gmail.com`  
**Password:** `123456rakhi`

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ **Actions Column**: Shows "Actions" header with "⋯" buttons
- ✅ **Actions Menu**: Clicking "⋯" shows dropdown with Active/Annotated/Completed options
- ✅ **Manager Column**: Shows "Admin" for projects created by admin
- ✅ **Tab Filtering**: Uses category-based filtering (existing behavior)
- ✅ **All Features**: Everything works exactly as before

### Scenario 2: Client Login (New Features)
**Email:** Any other email (e.g., `test@example.com`)  
**Password:** Any password

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ **Status Column**: Shows "Status" header instead of "Actions"
- ✅ **Status Display**: Shows colored status text:
  - "Active" (green) for working projects
  - "Annotated" (orange) for annotated projects  
  - "Completed" (gray) for completed projects
- ✅ **Manager Column**: Shows "Client" for projects created by other users
- ✅ **Tab Filtering**: Uses status-based filtering:
  - Active tab → projects with "working on" status
  - Pipeline Projects tab → projects with "annotated" status
  - Archived tab → projects with "completed" status
- ✅ **No Actions Menu**: Cannot change project statuses

## Step-by-Step Testing

2. Enter: `dhaneshwari.tosscss@gmail.com` / `123456rakhi`
3. Navigate to Projects Overview
4. **Verify**: Actions column with "⋯" buttons
5. **Click**: Any "⋯" button to see dropdown menu
6. **Check**: Tabs filter by category (existing behavior)

### 2. Test Client Login
1. Logout from admin account
2. Register/Login with different email (e.g., `client@test.com`)
3. Navigate to Projects Overview
4. **Verify**: Status column with colored text
5. **Check**: No "⋯" buttons (no actions menu)
6. **Test**: Click different tabs to see status-based filtering

## Visual Differences

| Feature | Admin User | Client User |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Column Header | "Actions" | "Status" |
| Column Content | "⋯" buttons | Colored status text |
| Manager Column | Based on project creator | Based on project creator |
| Actions Menu | ✅ Available | ❌ Not available |
| Tab Filtering | Category-based | Status-based |
| Status Colors | N/A | Green/Orange/Gray |

## Troubleshooting

### If Admin Features Don't Show:
1. Check if `dhaneshwari.tosscss@gmail.com` has admin role
2. Verify user roles are loading correctly
3. Check browser console for errors

### If Client Features Don't Show:
1. Ensure you're logged in with different email
2. Check if user has client role (should be automatic)
3. Verify role detection logic is working

## Status: Ready for Testing ✅

# Manager Column Logic - Fixed ✅

## Summary
The Manager column now correctly shows the project creator's role, not the current user's role.

## Logic Implementation

### **Manager Column Display:**
```javascript
{project.created_by?.email === 'dhaneshwari.tosscss@gmail.com' ? 'Admin' : 'Client'}
```

### **How It Works:**

1. **Check Project Creator**: Looks at `project.created_by.email`
2. **Admin Projects**: If creator email is `dhaneshwari.tosscss@gmail.com` → Shows "Admin"
3. **Client Projects**: If creator email is anything else → Shows "Client"

## Examples

### **Scenario 1: Admin Creates Project**
- **Creator**: `dhaneshwari.tosscss@gmail.com`
- **Manager Column**: Shows "Admin"
- **Visible to**: Both admin and client users

### **Scenario 2: Client Creates Project**
- **Creator**: `client@example.com` (or any other email)
- **Manager Column**: Shows "Client"
- **Visible to**: Both admin and client users

## Updated Features

### **Search Functionality:**
- Can search by "admin" or "client" to filter projects by creator type
- Works for both admin and client users

### **Sorting Functionality:**
- Can sort by Manager column
- Groups admin-created projects together
- Groups client-created projects together

## Testing Scenarios

### **Test 1: Admin Login**
- Login as `dhaneshwari.tosscss@gmail.com`
- **Expected**: 
  - Projects created by admin show "Admin" in Manager column
  - Projects created by others show "Client" in Manager column
  - Actions column with "⋯" buttons

### **Test 2: Client Login**
- Login as any other email
- **Expected**:
  - Projects created by admin show "Admin" in Manager column  
  - Projects created by others show "Client" in Manager column
  - Status column with colored text

## Key Benefits

1. **Accurate Information**: Shows who actually created/manages each project
2. **Consistent Display**: Same manager info for all users viewing the same project
3. **Clear Ownership**: Easy to identify admin vs client-created projects
4. **Searchable**: Can filter projects by creator type

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The Manager column now correctly reflects project ownership rather than current user role!

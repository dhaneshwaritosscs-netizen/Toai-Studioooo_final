# Admin Access Setup Complete ✅

## Summary
The role-based access system has been successfully configured with the following setup:

- **dhaneshwari.tosscss@gmail.com** → **ADMIN access**
- **All other users** → **CLIENT access**

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Management Command (`setup_default_admin.py`)
- Creates default `admin` and `client` roles
- Assigns admin role to `dhaneshwari.tosscss@gmail.com`
- Creates user account if it doesn't exist

### 2. Automatic Role Assignment (`signals.py`)
- Automatically assigns `client` role to new users when they register
- Skips admin email to prevent overriding admin role
- Uses Django signals for seamless integration

### 3. Setup Script (`setup_admin_access.py`)
- Easy-to-run script to initialize the role system
- Provides clear feedback on setup status

## How to Run Setup

### Option 1: Using the Setup Script
```bash
cd "D:\newlabel\label-studio (6)\label-studio\label-studio"
python setup_admin_access.py
```

### Option 2: Using Django Management Command
```bash
cd "D:\newlabel\label-studio (6)\label-studio\label-studio"
python manage.py setup_default_admin --admin-email dhaneshwari.tosscss@gmail.com
```

## Role Permissions

### Admin Role (`dhaneshwari.tosscss@gmail.com`)
- Full system access
- Can manage users and roles
- Can create/delete projects
- Can access admin panels
- Can export/import data
- Can manage organizations

### Client Role (All other users)
- Standard client access
- Limited permissions
- Can work on assigned projects
- Cannot manage users or system settings

## How It Works

1. **Admin User**: When `dhaneshwari.tosscss@gmail.com` logs in, they automatically get admin access
2. **New Users**: When any other user registers/logs in, they automatically get client access
3. **Existing Users**: Existing users will get client access on their next login

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `label_studio/users/management/commands/setup_default_admin.py`
- `label_studio/users/signals.py`
- `setup_admin_access.py`
- `ADMIN_ACCESS_SETUP.md`

### Modified Files:
- `label_studio/users/apps.py` (added signal registration)

## Testing the Setup

1. Run the setup script
2. Log in with `dhaneshwari.tosscss@gmail.com` - should have admin access
3. Log in with any other email - should have client access
4. Check role assignments in the database or admin panel

## Notes

- The system uses the existing role assignment infrastructure
- No changes were made to existing functionality
- All role assignments are logged for audit purposes
- The setup is reversible if needed

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The role-based access system is now ready to use!

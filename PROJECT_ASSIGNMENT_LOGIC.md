# Project Assignment Logic - Implemented ✅

## Summary
Successfully implemented role-based project assignment logic for Admin and Client users in the user management modal.

## Implementation Details

### **Admin Login Logic:**

#### **If Project is Assigned:**
- ✅ Shows **"Assigned"** button (disabled/grayed out)
- ✅ Shows **"Remove"** button (active/red)

#### **If Project is Removed (Unassigned):**
- ✅ Shows **"Assign"** button (active/green)
- ✅ Shows **"Remove"** button (disabled/grayed out)

### **Client Login Logic:**

#### **If Project is Assigned to Client:**
- ✅ Shows **"Assigned"** button (disabled/grayed out)
- ✅ **No Remove button** (clients cannot remove themselves)

#### **If Project is Removed (Unassigned by Admin):**
- ✅ Shows alert: **"You have been removed from this project."**
- ✅ **Projects remain in list** (no deletion)
- ✅ If visible, shows **"Assign"** button (active/green)

## Technical Implementation

### **Button State Logic:**
```javascript
{isAdmin ? (
  // Admin Logic
  <>
    {user.isAssigned ? (
      <button disabled>Assigned</button>
    ) : (
      <button onClick={assign}>Assign</button>
    )}
    <button 
      onClick={remove} 
      disabled={!user.isAssigned}
    >
      Remove
    </button>
  </>
) : (
  // Client Logic
  <>
    {user.isAssigned ? (
      <button disabled>Assigned</button>
    ) : (
      <button onClick={assign}>Assign</button>
    )}
  </>
)}
```

### **Client Removal Logic:**
```javascript
if (!isAdmin && userId === user?.id) {
  alert("You have been removed from this project.");
  // Close modal
  return;
}
```

## User Experience

### **Admin Users:**
- **Full Control**: Can assign and remove any user
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear button states (enabled/disabled)
- **Project Management**: Can manage all project assignments

### **Client Users:**
- **Limited Control**: Can only assign themselves
- **Clear Notification**: Alert message when removed
- **Projects Remain**: Projects stay in list even when removed
- **Self-Service**: Can assign themselves to available projects

## Button States

| User Role | Assignment Status | Assign Button | Remove Button |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Admin** | Assigned | Disabled ("Assigned") | Active (Red) |
| **Admin** | Unassigned | Active (Green) | Disabled (Gray) |
| **Client** | Assigned | Disabled ("Assigned") | Not Shown |
| **Client** | Unassigned | Active (Green) | Not Shown |

## Key Features

1. **Role-Based Access**: Different button sets for admin vs client
2. **State Management**: Proper button enabling/disabling
3. **Client Protection**: Clients cannot remove themselves
4. **No Project Deletion**: Projects remain in list even when users are removed
5. **User Feedback**: Clear messages for all actions
6. **Simple Management**: Just disable/enable buttons, no complex deletion logic

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The role-based project assignment logic is now fully implemented and ready for testing!

# Role-Based UI Changes Complete ✅

## Summary
Successfully implemented role-based UI changes for the Projects Overview page:

- **Admin users**: Keep existing UI and functionality exactly as it is today
- **Client users**: Modified UI with Status column and status-based tab filtering

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Role Detection
- Added `useUserRoles` hook import
- Added role-based logic: `isAdmin` and `isClient` variables
- Default fallback: users without admin role are treated as clients

### 2. Tab Filtering Logic
**Admin Users (unchanged):**
- Active tab → projects with `category === 'active'`
- Pipeline Projects tab → projects with `category === 'pipeline'`
- Archived tab → projects with `category === 'archived'`

**Client Users (new):**
- Active tab → projects with `statusText === 'working on'`
- Pipeline Projects tab → projects with `statusText === 'annotated'`
- Archived tab → projects with `statusText === 'completed'`

### 3. Column Header Changes
- **Admin users**: Shows "Actions" column header
- **Client users**: Shows "Status" column header

### 4. Column Content Changes
**Admin Users (unchanged):**
- Actions column shows "⋯" button
- Clicking opens dropdown menu with Active/Annotated/Completed options

**Client Users (new):**
- Status column shows text status:
  - "Active" (green color) for `statusText === 'working on'`
  - "Annotated" (orange color) for `statusText === 'annotated'`
  - "Completed" (gray color) for `statusText === 'completed'`

### 5. Project Count Updates
- Tab counts now reflect the appropriate filtering logic for each user role
- Active count, Pipeline count, and Archived count are calculated based on user role

### 6. Actions Menu Visibility
- Actions dropdown menu is only rendered for admin users
- Client users cannot access the actions menu functionality

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
- `web/apps/labelstudio/src/pages/ProjectsOverview/ProjectsOverview.jsx`

### Key Changes:
1. **Import**: Added `useUserRoles` hook
2. **Role Logic**: Added `isAdmin` and `isClient` variables
3. **Filtering**: Modified `getFilteredProjects()` function for role-based filtering
4. **Counts**: Updated project count calculations
5. **UI**: Conditional rendering based on user role
6. **Actions Menu**: Restricted to admin users only

## User Experience

### Admin Users (`dhaneshwari.tosscss@gmail.com`)
- **No changes** - everything works exactly as before
- Full access to all features and functionality
- Actions column with dropdown menu for status changes

### Client Users (all other users)
- **Cleaner interface** - Status column shows current project status
- **Simplified navigation** - Tabs filter by actual project status
- **No actions menu** - Cannot change project statuses
- **Status-based filtering** - More intuitive project organization

## Status Mapping

| Tab Name | Admin Filter | Client Filter | Status Display |
|----------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Active | `category === 'active'` | `statusText === 'working on'` | "Active" (green) |
| Pipeline Projects | `category === 'pipeline'` | `statusText === 'annotated'` | "Annotated" (orange) |
| Archived | `category === 'archived'` | `statusText === 'completed'` | "Completed" (gray) |

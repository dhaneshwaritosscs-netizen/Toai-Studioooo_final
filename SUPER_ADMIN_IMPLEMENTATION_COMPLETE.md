## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### **Role Detection Logic:**
```javascript
// Frontend role detection
const isSuperAdmin = hasRole('super-admin') || currentUser?.email === 'superadmin@gmail.com';
const isAdmin = hasRole('admin') || currentUser?.email === 'dhaneshwari.tosscss@gmail.com' || isSuperAdmin;
const isClient = !isAdmin;
```

### **Backend Role Detection:**
```python
def _is_super_admin(self, user):
    if user.email == 'superadmin@gmail.com':
        return True
    if getattr(user, 'is_superuser', False):
        return True
    try:
        return UserRoleAssignment.objects.filter(
            user=user, 
            role__name__in=['super-admin', 'super_admin'], 
            is_active=True
        ).exists()
    except Exception:
        return False
```

### **Data Visibility Rules:**
- **Super Admin**: Sees all users and projects
- **Admin**: Sees only users they created and projects they created/assigned
- **Client**: Sees only users they created and projects assigned to them

## ðŸŽ¯ User Interface Changes
